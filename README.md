# GapDetection
An Application to Detect Gaps in an Excel Postion Rotation System.

## About The Project
Assiging all the positions an employee will work for their entire shift is actually very easy when only dealing with a few employees. It is only when there is an enormously increasing amount employees that errors can and will occur. Like when a certain position only needs one employee to have that position at any given moment in time. Sometimes multiple employees may be assigned that position at the same time, when only one employee is required. Or the certain position will not be assigned at all. 

Therefore, the need to check for gaps or duplications arises. This application checks to see if there are any gaps for given positions that need to be assigned throughout the shifts. It also checks to see if any position has been assigned multiple times at a given time that should only be assigned once.

The application also allows you to create an area (Venue) and create that area's positions and then visually displays the gaps or duplications.

## Project Description

The main menu has a dropdown and two buttons. The dropdown allows you to choose a venue. The button on the left goes to the gap display window. The button on the right goes the settings window.

The settings window allows you to create a venue or select one. One the left side of the window is where you add or delete a selected venueâ€™s positions. You can also arrange the order of the positions as how they will appear in the gap detection display. Once you are done creating a venue/position, you can save the progress.

From the main, select a venue and click the gap button. This will take you to the gap window. The Gap window consists of a top and bottom time bar, two position legends and the center where the gap information will be displayed. In the middle there are dark gray squares. Each row of gray squars falls in line with a specific position on the position legend. The program will check if the position on the postion legend is represented in the excel file within that particular time interval. If it is, then the gray square will turn blue. If not, then it will stay gray.

This is the menu tab. It has three options. The first is, Open File. This will allow you to open specific excel files to use with the application. The second is Check For Gaps. This will read the information on the excel file and translate it to the gap display window. The third is Main Menu. This will take you back to the main menu.

Select Open File. Choose the excel file. The excel will open. This is what it will look like.

After the excel is opened select Check Gaps from the display menue. The gap display will now be filled with light blue squares.

To show an example: If you delete the "GTR" position from the excel file as it is shown here and then click on the Check Gaps button, the Gap Display should change the corrosponding blue squares back to gray.

As it is shown here. The blue squares have disappeared at the same time as it appears on the excel file. As well as within the same row that the position exists on the position legend.

The program also checks for duplicatation in positions. If a position should only exist one time at any given point in time, the gray square will turn red and will display the number of times that position exist at that time. 

Here, the GTR position has changed to LD3. There is also another LD3 position three rows down as well.

<img src="GapPics/SHIFTSLD3.JPG" alt="Logo" width="1050" height="300">

As you see here, not only does the program show the GTR position empty in the same spot but it also show four red squares with the number of times LD3 exists at the same time. Which is 2 for each red square.

## What I Learned
How to take a small application through inception to deployment. Setup and intergrate sqlite data file along with application. Separation of code through the use of MVVM, class libraries. Creating an IoC container to eliminate or reduce dependencies throughout the application. Setup a database to stored and manipulate data.
